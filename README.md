# What is Magic Button?

It's a new button in android that hypnotizes the user and make him give you a lot of money!!! <br/>
Ok, just kidding, this is not so magic yet... but it's a cute button. <br/> <br/> <br/>

# Ok it's cute, But how can I use

You just need to add this in your layout.

```xml
<br.com.bloder.magic.view.MagicButton
        android:id="@+id/magic_button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:magic_button_size="50dp"
        app:button_icon="@drawable/your_icon"
        app:button_icon_width="25dp"
        app:button_icon_height="25dp"
        app:hide_text="Hi Mom!"
        app:hide_text_size="15dp"
        app:hide_text_color="@android:color/black"
        app:icon_button_color="button_icon_color"
        app:expandable_area_color="that_expandable_button_part_color"/>
```

# How about click event?

In magic button, the click event will work only in second click and you can set this event with:

```java
magicButton.setMagicButtonClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
      @Override
      public void onClick(View v) {
        yourAction();
      }
});
```
